# FP-growth with Item Constraints

This project implements the FP-growth algorithm with item occurrence constraints for discovering association rules.

## Description

The goal is to develop an efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets with specific item constraints, and to evaluate its performance on various datasets.

## Datasets

The following publicly available datasets are used:
- Online Retail Dataset
- BMS-WebView-1
- Retail Dataset

## Structure

- `datasets/`: Contains the datasets used for the experiments.
- `src/`: Source code for the FP-growth implementation.
- `presentation/`: Contains the preliminary design presentation.

## Usage

To run the project, navigate to the `src` directory and execute the `main.py` script.

```sh
cd src
python main.py
